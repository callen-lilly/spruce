Description: Spruce allows for identification of cell sub-populations within tissue samples using
  Bayesian multivariate mixture models with spatial random effects to account for a wide range of 
  spatial gene expression patterns. Bayesian inference is conducted using efficient Gibbs sampling 
  implemented using 'Rcpp'.
