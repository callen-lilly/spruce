## A suite of Bayesian multivariate finite mixture models for clustering single cell spatial transcriptomics data. 

The `spruce` package is a robust and comprehensive tool for analyzing single cell spatial transcriptomics data using Bayesian multivariate finite mixture models. We accommodate multiple gene expression distributions, including multivariate normal (MVN), multivariate skew-normal (MSN), and multivariate skew-$t$ (MST). We also allow for a range of spatial assumptions that rely on spatially correlated CAR models for random intercepts and sptial prior smoothing in cluster indicators.
